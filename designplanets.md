Design Document for future planet content.

Moon- Molten Cheese. 'Nuff said.

Mars- The Galacticraft reference planet. Misc references to Galacticraft content, but most importantly: 
Hsed which is definitely not Desh spelled backwards. (Textures are ripped directly from 1.12 Galacticraft and color inverted, no texture modernization at all) Ingots are an alloy of 1 Hsed chunks and 1 netherite scrap. 
Hsed is used as outer plating for heat-resistant spacesuits. Used in Isothermal Alloy.

Venus- The Useful planet. Atmosphere can be processed into improved rocket fuel, has ores:
Ignite (Ign-ite like Wolfram-ite), coal equivalent, can do smelting recipes in the crafting grid, though one ignite can smelt a lot more if used in a furnace.
Rathite, iron equivalent, pressure-resistant material, used to craft books of Capacity 4 (8 ingots) and Capacity 6 (8 blocks)
Berathyl is a pressure-resistant alloy of Beryllium and Rathite, 1 ingot is 8 blocks of Rathite and one ingot of Beryllium. Crafts books of Capacity 8 (8 ingots) and Capacity 10 (8 blocks).
Scorched Gems, diamond equivalent, utility material. Used in Isothermal Alloy, upgrades books of Capacity (4->5 w/ 2, 6->7 w/ 4, 8->9 w/ 8)

Mercury- The Hot planet. Enables use of the Light Focuser (think mechanical press but light), which allows creation of Enkindled Metal from zinc.
Enkindled Metal is used as outer plating for cold-resistant spacesuits. Used in Isothermal Alloy.

Asteroid Belt- The resource "planet". Very cold, enabling use of the Heat Siphon (think mechanical press but cooling) which is required for assembling isothermal spacesuits. Has many resources:
Metallic asteroids, made of blocks of raw ore from vanilla and mods.
Carbonaceous asteroids, made of coal, maybe oil?
Silicaceous asteroids, made of rock, gravel, sand, etc.
Oxygen Ice, found in and around all asteroids mixed with regular ice, which can be crafted with Ignite and a backtank to refill the backtank. Also can be processed into liquid oxygen for rockets very cheaply.
